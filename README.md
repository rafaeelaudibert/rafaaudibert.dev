# Portfolio

This is my current website and/or portfolio and/or resume.
It is built with Gatsby and React, fully configurable.

In the `dev` branch we have the code, and it is deployed
to `master` whenever there are changes, so that we can keep
[the website](https://rafaeelaudibert.github.io) up to date.
